# Prolog

The purpose of this assignment is for you to gain some experience designing and implementing Prolog programs.
This assignment explores only a few of the many interesting Prolog features.
This assignment is broken into several parts. The first few parts are fairly straightforward Prolog warmups.
The remaining parts, which are more challenging, involve using Prologâ€™s backtracking to generate possible
workplace schedules.
